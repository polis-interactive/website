        title: 'Product Design',
        information: `Have you met Dann? Representing the optimistic half of Polis, 
        Dann is the head—pronounced only—product designer here on staff. Back in the day, 
        he founded a company called Nido whose hammock stand design is now featured at every 
        REI in the country; when they aren't sold out, of course. Anything physical here at Polis 
        has his name all over it, which speaks to our work's ease of installation, aesthetic 
        beauty, and maintainability.`

    {
        title: 'Software Development',
        information: `Broose is a full stack software engineer, and he doesn't let us forget it. 
        And not like "full stack" like web development, but like reeeeeally full stack. 
        Like, remotely controlling robots and writing drawing programs that directly talk to 
        the graphics card. We're not sure on the specifics, but we're sure if you ask him he'd 
        love to chat your ear off about it. Just be careful opening up that pandoras box...`
    },
    {
        title: 'Environmental Lighting',
        information: `The problem with tech-art is that it's easy to get typecasted 
        "the LED guys." You know, because the easiest way to make an impact with some 
        microcontrollers and a couple of lines of code is lighting. Well, we've since acquiesced 
        our luminous reputation and turned it into expertise. From controlling thousands of 
        addressable LEDs to creating custom fixtures, we can meet any lighting need you may have.`
    },
    {
        title: 'Electrical Systems',
        information: `A product of our doing exclusively tech-art is expertise in electronics. 
        Power budgets, ampacity ratings, and conduit runs are second nature to us at this point, 
        and we've thankfully had many an electrician friend to lean on while we learned the trade. 
        A fancy degree in engineering might give you an appreciation of the craft, but doing the thing 
        is sure to take you down a few pegs. From solar rigs to site-specific installations, we now 
        pride ourselves on our code-following practices and professional execution.`
    },
    {
        title: 'Digital Fabrication',
        information: `It's time to brag that we've been using 3D printers since before they were cool. 
        Heck, Dann used to create the prototypes for his company using a big ol' hypercube printer we 
        built from scratch! We've since moved on and up to more capable machines including, but not 
        limited to: a 5'x10' CNC router with an automatic tool changer; a 2'x4' laser cutter; several 
        3D printers of various make and size. We use our robotic friends to create bespoke elements in 
        all of our projects; tailoring every enclosure, structural element, and stick of furniture to site.`
    },
    {
        title: 'Systems Integration',
        information: `Did we ever mention that time when Polis got absorbed? We are thankful for the 
        time we spent at Wilder Systems, a local aerospace robotics manufacturing outfit here in Austin, 
        Texas, that led us down the path of systems integration. Which means what exactly? It means taking 
        off-the-shelf technologies, such as machines or cloud interfaces, and gluing them together to 
        make a feature-rich system. At Wilder, we had everything from robot arms to pipetting liquid 
        handlers all communicating and coordinating in a single cell. Now, we have our Slate pieces 
        hooked up to Alexa, our Something Cool tile piece hooked up to a VPN so that we can update it 
        remotely, and our Highland Collective sign connected to a web app that lets anyone play with it!`
    },
    {
        title: 'Creative Network',
        information: `Our last shop, affectionately referred to as old Polis, was a marvel. We do not 
        mean this lightly. It had its drawbacks; low lighting, a lack of insulation. The office space 
        was cramped and dank, uncomfortable as can be. But the place was made incredible by the various 
        creative and caring people that frequented it. Ceiling to floor murals—we mean this literally. 
        Like, there were murals on the ceiling, walls, and floor; even in the bathroom!—spanned the 2000sqft 
        building with 18ft ceilings, and inspired all who stepped through its bay doors. Metalworkers, 
        sculptors, and fabricators could frequently be found executing their craft in the shops back. 
        We are proud to boast about the friends we've made along the way, knowing that finding someone 
        with a specific skillset we don't have is just a phone call away.`
    },
    {
        title: 'Design, Build, Install',
        information: `Here at Polis, we are confused about the state of affairs in this world. 
        Too often we find that architectural sculptures are conceptualized by artists, who contract 
        engineers to design them, fabricators to build them, electricians to wire them, and a crew 
        to install them. This is a foreign concept to us, as we are intimately a part of each step. 
        This is not to say we don't consult with experts if we are unsure of a craft, or don't hire 
        out when we need multiple hands for an installation. We won't, however, throw our hands up at 
        any step in the process of making something and yell "that's someone else's problem". We work 
        hard to figure things out ourselves and grow as we add more skills to our belts. It is a 
        philosophy that is arduous and inadvisable, yet deeply rewarding, and we will stand to 
        it by any means.`
    },
    {
        title: 'Machine Design',
        information: `I guess we've talked about machines some, but have we talked about them 
        enough? Like this one time, we got contracted to build the automated hole measurer (AHM). 
        It was a small gantry-based system that moved a dial indicator around and, you guessed it, 
        measured holes! It then sent these hole measurements off into the cloud, specifically a 
        bunch of google sheets, to be analyzed by someone with a higher pay grade. Our friend Lucas, 
        originally tasked with measuring these holes, was very thankful for the device. It saved him 
        about 200 hours of time, his shoulder, and his sanity!`
    },
    {
        title: 'Prose and Rhetoric',
        information: `How's your experience been on this website thus far? Have you felt engaged, 
        griping the mouse, looking for more? Strange coincidence, we wrote all the content on this 
        site! Go figure. Our work should speak for itself, allowing us to write high-caliber 
        proposals and the like.`
    },
    {
        title: 'Art?',
        information: `You've heard us talk a lot about this boring "engineering" stuff, but what 
        does that have to do with art? Polis is an interactive installation group, so what's up with that?
        <br /><br />
        We could sit here and debate philosophy with you, how anything performed at a high level has an 
        aesthetic appeal to it, but that's just pedantic. Instead, we want to get across that just because 
        we're all in on the artistic value of the things we make, we don't overlook practical implementation 
        either. We like to experiment with different media, and tech to boot, which is a highly technical challenge. 
        We want to assure you that we will be able to pull off anything that can be dreamt up and that 
        we are up to the task!`
