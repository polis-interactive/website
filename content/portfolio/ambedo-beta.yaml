narrative: >
  Commissioned by the Waller Creek Conservancy for the 6th annual
  Creek Show, Ambedo Beta is a set of portals that are an interactive, immersive
  art installation inspired by the Myth of the Waller Creek Monster. Two other-worldly
  phone booths stand at both ends of the tunnels, encouraging visitors to dial in and
  talk to the Creatures of the Creek who have created the bridge between their language
  and ours. The participants voice illuminates the lighting frames throughout the three
  tunnels in various patterns. The Portals remind Austin that although they may not always
  be apparent, the Creatures are always here.
