narrative: >
      Commissioned by the Waller Creek Conservancy for the 6th annual
      Creek Show, Ambedo Beta is a set of portals that are an interactive, immersive
      art installation inspired by the Myth of the Waller Creek Monster. Two other-worldly
      phone booths stand at both ends of the tunnels, encouraging visitors to dial in and
      talk to the Creatures of the Creek who have created the bridge between their language
      and ours. The participants voice illuminates the lighting frames throughout the three
      tunnels in various patterns. The Portals remind Austin that although they may not always
      be apparent, the Creatures are always here.
