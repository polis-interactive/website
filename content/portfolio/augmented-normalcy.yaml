narrative: >
  Originally slated for Hopscotch's San Antonio location in 2020, Augmented Normalcy was put on ice due to the COVID-19
  pandemic. Luckily, with the opening of their new location in Portland, Augmented Normalcy now sees the light of
  day! Well, maybe not "of the day" as it's inside a gallery, but that's neither here nor there. Our original submission
  video here serves as a description of the piece, which vaguely matches the inscription of an edge-lit acrylic slab
  sitting outside the exhibit's entryway.
