  Color Therapy is an alternative remedy that uses color and light to treat physical 
  or mental health by balancing the body's energy centers. This installation celebrates 
  the impact of color on guests by surrounding them within a circular room of 12bit RGB light. 
  As colors shifts and perform in parallel to the accompanying soundscape, guests are invited to 
  let their sense fall prey to the endless periphery of light.
