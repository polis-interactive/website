narrative: >
  Polis was lucky to work so closely alongside the artist Ilya Tinker, Sparkplug before she skipped town for greener
  pastures for her new employer Meow Wolf. Tired of the flat and ordinary we humans pump out daily, Sparky always
  strives to push the limits of her materials to create flowing, organic shapes that mimic nature.
  
  Polis handled the electronics and programming on this one; to complement the multi-planar sinusoidal curves of the
  sculpture, we created a playful waltz of color that gracefully flows over time.
