narrative: >
  To stamp our presence in the Highland neighborhood, members of our collective decided to 
  erect a place-making sign at the front of our shop. Flexing our skills as makers, we turned
  our sign into an interactive experience, where passerby can jump on a website and play with
  lighting in a variety of modes.
