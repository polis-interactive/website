narrative: >
  In collaboration with Studio Metric, Polis designed and built the hardware and software for the
  Jam Station, a prototype analog Spotify Player. 
  <br /><br />
  Tired of bluetooth connectivity issues, the members of the Highland Collective set out to build a Spotify 
  player for our shop sound system. Members now use a custom webapp to attach Spotify playlist to physical 
  buttons, where a custom PCB relays physical input to a Raspberry Pi. The high tech solution masks
  its complexity in a low tech interface, reducing the cognitive burden of wanting to play music.
