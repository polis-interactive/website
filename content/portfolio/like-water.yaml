narrative: >
  Commissioned by AIPP, Like Water is a collaborative effort with local artist J Muzacz 
  to create something innovative, unique, and personal for the residents of the Rosewood Neighborhood. 
  We have brought our mediums of mosaic and technology together to create a series of artistically 
  backlit mosaics, a first of their kind, that wraps around the structure of the new bath and features 
  outstanding members of the Rosewood community.
