narrative: >
  The largest and least abstract slate piece to date, Polis was commissioned to make Niagara Drop
  for the staff break room at a new office building of the Niagara Bottling company. The classic
  caustics pattern is displayed slowly moving through the Niagara logo, in homage to the water that
  was sold to make this piece possible. Dimming controls were added so the work could be tuned down
  to that perfect ambient glow, or turned up to celebrate a good days work.
