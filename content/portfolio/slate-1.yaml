narrative: >
  The Slate series represents experimentation between Polis and J Muzacz to further the 
  concept of backlit mosaics. These abstract compositions seek to investigate the use of 
  colored lighting. We've found that the tiles act as color filters; for instance, a red tile 
  may only be illuminated by red, magenta, or orange light while blocking anything on the spectrum 
  between green and blue. Passing smooth gradients of colored light between the tiles, intricately 
  complex patterns emerge, further highlighted by the various individual textures of the underlying mosaic.
