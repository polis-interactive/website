narrative: >
  In collaboration with J Muzacz, the third piece in our Slate series, Molten Pearl represents 
  our first experimentation of complex mosaic composition using our backlit mosaic techniques. 
  A poly-chrome tile gradient cuts across the diagonal of the work, weaving in and out sharp 
  grout boundaries to mimic the flow of lava. Unlike previous pieces in the series, light is 
  not used to change the color of the tiles, but is instead used to highlight and animate the formation.
