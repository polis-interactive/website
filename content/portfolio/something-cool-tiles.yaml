  Hot on the backlit mosaic tile bandwagon, we bring you lit up 80's glass blocks!
  <br /><br />
  This custom installation for our friends at Something Cool Studios is hidden
  in plan site; control electronics are disguised as a nondescript junction box, and
  a light panel is flush mount to an inset window frame. A prominent feature of the gallery,
  the piece can quickly set the vibe of the room, while giving patrons an interactive
  element to play with.
