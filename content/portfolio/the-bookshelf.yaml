narrative: >
  The Bookshelf is a lending library for the Mueller Neighborhood. It takes the form of 
  an open book resting on the ground. One side of the Bookshelf holds shelves for people 
  to exchange books, DVDs, and board games on, while the other side acts as seating for readers.
  <br /><br />
  The bookshelf features lighting placed withing the "pages" of the book, and features interactive 
  elements. It is completely off the grid, using solar panels and a battery array for power.
  <br /><br />
  The Bookshelf will be home to a number of events in the Mueller community for years to come.
