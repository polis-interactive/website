  Polis recently had the privilege of doing the electrical buildout for the Texas Harm Reduction Alliance (THRA)’s new mobile
  clinic. The mobile clinic provides outreach to Austin’s most vulnerable communities, providing them
  with clean supplies, wound care, and temporary shelter. We were able to do our part by outfitting the mobile clinic with a solar power system, 
  WiFi, and a GPS tracking service that allows individuals to find the clinic over text messages.
