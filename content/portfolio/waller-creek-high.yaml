narrative: >
  Waller Creek High, A School for Extraordinary Fish,
  is composed of injection molded fish sculptures made of recycled materials that
  swoop over the creek to mimic the form of a school. To avoid waste, the
  individual luminaries were made available for purchase during and after the Creek Show, with a portion
  of the proceeds going to the Waterloo Greenway Conservancy.
