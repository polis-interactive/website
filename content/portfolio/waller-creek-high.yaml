narrative: >
  For this 10th anniversary of the Creek Show, the Waller Creek High Class of 2024 students have
  prepared this demonstration, showcasing their linguistic mastery of the language of light.
  The student council has each prepared a selection of poetry they’ve found most pleasing to the human optic nerves,
  and on command, they will lead the school through its recitation. With Headmaster Creek Monster at the helm,
  come witness the efforts of these matriculating fish and see the strides they’ve made toward becoming extraordinary
  members of our shared community.
